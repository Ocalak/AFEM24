#Is it possible to work with Python and R. An example GAMS is not avaliable in Python.

#How should we integrate city and holiday information into the model to improve forecast accuracy?


For example, in Spain, it is very complex to include in the prediction model the different holidays [1], some of a national nature that affect the whole system and others of a regional and local nature that affect only part of it.
These holidays usually are associated with a specific date (May 1st, for example) and are celebrated each year on a different day of the week. The impact on the demand for a holiday on a Monday is very different than when the same holiday is celebrated on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Considering all these details is essential and requires the use of hundreds of parameters in the Spanish model of hourly prediction [2].
